# Computer Vision with Python
Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.

The problem of computer vision appears simple because it is trivially solved by people, even very young children. Nevertheless, it largely remains an unsolved problem based both on the limited understanding of biological vision and because of the complexity of vision perception in a dynamic and nearly infinitely varying physical world.

## Applications:
Computer vision is one of the areas in Machine Learning where core concepts are already being integrated into major products that we use every day.

__1.CV In Self-Driving Cars:__
But it’s not just tech companies that are leverage Machine Learning for image applications.
Computer vision enables self-driving cars to make sense of their surroundings. Cameras capture video from different angles around the car and feed it to computer vision software, which then processes the images in real-time to find the extremities of roads, read traffic signs, detect other cars, objects and pedestrians. The self-driving car can then steer its way on streets and highways, avoid hitting obstacles, and (hopefully) safely drive its passengers to their destination.
__2.CV In Facial Recognition:__
Computer vision also plays an important role in facial recognition applications, the technology that enables computers to match images of people’s faces to their identities. Computer vision algorithms detect facial features in images and compare them with databases of face profiles. Consumer devices use facial recognition to authenticate the identities of their owners. Social media apps use facial recognition to detect and tag users. Law enforcement agencies also rely on facial recognition technology to identify criminals in video feeds.
__3.CV In Augmented Reality & Mixed Reality:__
Computer vision also plays an important role in augmented and mixed reality, the technology that enables computing devices such as smartphones, tablets and smart glasses to overlay and embed virtual objects on real world imagery. Using computer vision, AR gear detect objects in real world in order to determine the locations on a device’s display to place a virtual object. For instance, computer vision algorithms can help AR applications detect planes such as tabletops, walls and floors, a very important part of establishing depth and dimensions and placing virtual objects in physical world.
__4.CV In Healthcare:__
Computer vision has also been an important part of advances in health-tech. Computer vision algorithms can help automate tasks such as detecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scans.

## Many popular computer vision applications involve trying to recognize things in photographs:
- __Object Classification__: What broad category of object is in this photograph?
- __Object Identification__: Which type of a given object is in this photograph?
- __Object Verification__: Is the object in the photograph?
- __Object Detection__: Where are the objects in the photograph?
- __Object Landmark Detection__: What are the key points for the object in the photograph?
- __Object Segmentation__: What pixels belong to the object in the image?
- __Object Recognition__: What objects are in this photograph and where are they?
